1) move the GUI update components into a separate file. Created: 11/24  Completed: 11/24 SD
2) make the GUI optional - meaning allow the game to run without the visuals. - this will greatly speed up test times. Created: 11/24  Completed: 12/3
3) Create a file containing to contain our AI class and outline its requirements. Created: 11/24 Completed: 11/25 SD
4) Comment all functions of the base game. Created: 11/25 Completed: 12/3
5) Get a solid understanding of the game physics, then create the heuristics. Created: 11/25 Completed: 12/7

10) Allow for negative weights Created: 12/9 Completed: 12/9
11) Write each generation to a file for loggin purposes Created: 12/9 Completed: 12/9
12) Let the Algorithm run for a day at least: Created: 12/9 Completed: 12/10
